FADE IN:

EXT. ABANDONED GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Bone-chilling WINDS HOWL across the ancient tombstones, whistling through the BARE BRANCHES of OVERGROWN TREES. Our intrepid TRIO, ELLIE (11), JAKE (10), and MILO (9) stumble into view, lit only by the eerie GLOW of their FLASHLIGHTS. Their faces are a mix of apprehension and excitement.

                    ELLIE
          It's creepier than in the stories.

                    JAKE
          Milo, you sure your grandpa’s treasure is here?

Milo nods, clutching an ancient MAP, his eyes a blaze of determination.

                    MILO
          He used to be the caretaker. Swore there was a secret treasure hidden here.

Suddenly, a loud RUSTLE. They whip around, FLASHLIGHTS darting wildly in the darkness.

ANGLE ON: A BUSH, vibrating violently. The kids GASP as a FAT RABBIT springs out, bounding away. They LAUGH it off, hearts hammering.

Suddenly, a RED LASER BEAM cuts through the darkness, grazing Milo's face. Each kid's face turns pallid. Hushed whispers.

                    JAKE
          Omigosh. Are those…real lasers?

Cut to: THREE SINISTER FIGURES weave in and out of the shadows, LASER TAG GUNS in hand – THE GRIM REAPER, a PIRATE, and an ALIEN.

                    THE REAPER (O.S)
           Tag! You’re dead!

The kids SCREAM and bolt.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT

They scramble into a dilapidated MAUSOLEUM, SLAMMING the door shut. Inside, it's dark and eerie.

                    ELLIE
           Who are they?

                    MILO
           Treasure hunters! Like us!

Suddenly, Ellie spots something on the MAUSOLEUM WALL - a PIRATE SKULL.

                   ELLIE
           That skull…it's from the map!

Milo places the MAP against the wall. Suddenly, the FLOOR SHIFTS beneath them revealing an UNSEEN STAIRCASE.

CUT TO:

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

THE GRIM REAPER peers at the MAUSOLEUM.

                    THE REAPER
           Let's trap'em!

They charge the door.

CUT TO:

INT. SECRET CHAMBER - NIGHT

Our trio is peering awestruck at a PILE OF TREASURE. Suddenly, they hear MUFFLED VOICES. The grave hunters are coming.

                   JAKE
           We need to defend the treasure!

They devise a quick STRATEGY. Ellie finds a BAG OF MARBLES, Jake a PAIR OF OLD FENCING SWORDS, while Milo readies his catapult.

CUT TO:

EXT. MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT

As the grave hunters attack, it’s a CHAOTIC SLAPSTICK. The Reaper trips and crashes into the Pirate due to the marbles. The Alien, fencing with Jake, stumbles onto a rake flipping him into a grave. Milo bombards them with pebbles causing them to retreat.

Once the coast is clear, the children LAUGH and CHEER. The treasure is theirs!
