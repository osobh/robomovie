FADE IN:

INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Wide-eyed and out of breath, store MANAGER JOE (late 40s, receding hairline) watches with horror as THREE KIDS, demolish his well-organized store.

The eldest, TIMMY (10, rebellious), commands a rampaging shopping cart, unimaginably stacked. The middle one, SARAH (8, mischievous), darting between aisles creates havoc while little BILLY (5, adorable), atop a tower of toilet rolls giggles gleefully. 

The CUSTOMERS look on laughing, and some videorecord the madness.

MANAGER JOE
(into walkie-talkie)
Code Red! Chucky Cheese, aisle five!

Cut to the grocery store staff running helter-skelter, trying to control the chaos.

Timmy suddenly loses control of his cart. It crashes into pickle jars, the splattering of which, startles Sarah, causing her to trip into the vegetable bins; launching an explosive display of lettuce, tomatoes, and zucchinis. 

Billy, at a dizzying height, tumbles from the makeshift toilet-roll tower into a pile of bouncy balls. It detonates a colorful ball explosion. 

The spectacle sends everyone into roars of laughter, including Joe, his frustration yielding to infectious amusement. Lowering his walkie talkie, he laughs heartily.

Suddenly, a MOTHER (early 30s, exhausted) bursts into the grocery store. She stands wide-eyed at the spectacle, then noticing her children, throws her head back, exasperated but laughing.

MOTHER
(panting)
Totally... lost track... of time!

MANAGER JOE
(laughing)
No problem, maâ€™am. Free babysitting with every grocery trip. 

Everyone laughs. FADE OUT. 

The end.
