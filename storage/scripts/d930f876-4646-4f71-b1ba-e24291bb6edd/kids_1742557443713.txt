FADE IN:

EXT. WASTELANDS - DAY

Twins MAX and ALEX, both 13, energetic and resourceful, trek through the grim post-apocalyptic wastelands wearing makeshift armor, carrying scavenged weapons. Their youthful exuberance pierces through the desolation.

MAX:    
(pointing at a derelict building)
Raid that one next?

ALEX:    
(nods)
Bet you five worms I find better loot.

A dilapidated sign reads, "Smith Scientific Research". Max smirks, the pair bolt toward the building.

INT. SMITH SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH - DAY

They navigate dark halls filled with defunct technology, eerie silence heightening their alertness. Suddenly, a muffled WHIRRING sound begins. They stiffen, trade worried glances but press on.

ALEX:
(shaky voice)
Just the wind, right?

MAX:
(swallowing)
Right.    

They reach a door labeled 'Control Room'. Max slowly pushes the door, revealing an astonishing sight; A hulking ROBOT, seemingly stuck in a cycle of diddling with the control panels.

Alex gasps, trips, knocks down a piece of metal. The room echoes the CLANG. The Robot's head swivels sharply toward the noise, red sensors flickering to life.

MAX:
(whisper screams)
Run!

Both kids dash out, chased by the mechanical behemoth. Its powerful strides shake the building, debris raining from the ceiling.

EXT. WASTELANDS - DAY

They dart from the building, the robot crashing through the entrance, shadowing them. Their training at the survival camps kicks in. Alex tosses scrapped EMP grenades, the robot staggers but advances.

Max, spots an old powerline pole. He frantically reaches into his backpack, pulls out an old harpoon gun. He ties a makeshift electrified wire to the harpoon and takes aim at the pole.

MAX:
(yells)
Alex, down!

Alex dives as Max fires. The harpoon sinks into the pole, grounding the robot. Electricity sparks, and the robot shudders, powers down.

Max and Alex huff, share a triumphant glance, then a nervous laugh.

MAX:
So, guess you owe me five worms huh?

FADE OUT.
