INT. ALIEN SPACECRAFT - OUTER ORBIT - NIGHT

A technologically sophisticated ALIEN SPACECRAFT hovers silently over the newly discovered GOLD RICH PLANET. The ship's insides filled with paths with strange hieroglyphic markings, teaming with multispecies ALIEN CREW whizzing around, completing various tasks in an ant-like gesture. At the helm is ZA'KAL, a lion-like alien general with steely eyes and a commanding aura.

ZA'KAL
(transmitting orders in an alien language, subtitled to English)
"Prepare the drills. The 'gold rush' begins!"

EXT. GROUND ZERO - PLANET SURFACE - NIGHT

Alien machinery descends from the spacecraft, drilling swiftly into the planet's surface while the ground quakes violently. Suddenly, a fleet of HUMAN EXPLORER SPACECRAFTS break through the atmosphere, landing with a rumble. The leader is Captain EVE REYNOLDS, a hardened space cowgirl type, with grit in her eyes.

CAPTAIN REYNOLDS
(to the crew via intercom)
"Those ETs think they can mine OUR gold? Over my dead body."

INT. ALIEN SPACECRAFT - OUTER ORBIT - NIGHT

On seeing humans, Za'Kal smirks, a sound that resonates in the room. He orders his warriors into their battle stations.

ZA'KAL
(subtitled)
"These earthlings dare oppose us? Launch the Eradicators!"  

EXT. GROUND ZERO - PLANET SURFACE - NIGHT

The alien spacecraft launch massive robotic eradicators, resembling spiders, clattering towards the human expedition team. Captain Reynolds rallies her team.

CAPTAIN REYNOLDS 
(to the crew via intercom)
"All hands on deck. Let's give 'em hell!"

A fierce skirmish kicks off. Explosions, laser shots, and battle cries form a choir of galactic warfare. Captain Reynolds braces herself, then launches into the fray, her Power Saber shining bright.

INT. ALIEN SPACECRAFT - OUTER ORBIT - NIGHT

Za'Kal revels in the mayhem below, yet there's a glimpse of worry in his eyes. He sees something on his monitor: a colossal asteroid heading straight for Ground Zero - an extinction-level event. 

ZA'KAL
(subtitled)
"That asteroid...Cease fire! Emergency Evacuation!"

EXT. GROUND ZERO - PLANET SURFACE - NIGHT

Reynolds gets the same asteroid warning. She quickly orders her team to evacuate, but then a thought strikes her.

CAPTAIN REYNOLDS
(to herself)
"If that asteroid hits, the gold's gone...Time for a gamble."

With swift fiendish recklessness, she pilots her spaceship directly towards the oncoming asteroid.

INT. REYNOLD'S SPACECRAFT - IN ORBIT - NIGHT

Futuristic panels light up the cockpit with dire warnings, but Reynolds presses ahead. She fires her powerful mining lasers at the asteroid's trajectory, gambling everything on one shot.

CAPTAIN REYNOLDS
(to herself)
"Come on, baby. Hit the mark."

With a powerful explosion, the asteroid detonates, scattering in a burst of fire. A shock wave surges, pushing Reynolds' spaceship away, but not before she manages to spray the asteroid's trajectory with reflective paint.

EXT. GROUND ZERO - PLANET SURFACE - NIGHT

The scattered asteroid fragments, now glowing with reflective paint, hurtle towards the alien spacecraft. In a panic, Za'Kal orders an immediate retreat. The humans on the surface burst into cheers as they see the retreating aliens.

INT. ALIEN SPACECRAFT - OUTER ORBIT - NIGHT

Za'Kal palms his control panel in shame as his spacecraft enters warp speed. Echoing in the silent bridge is the immortal line:

ZA'KAL
(subtitled)
"...the earthlings defended their gold. And it wasn't even on their planet."

FADE OUT.
