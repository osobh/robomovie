FADE IN:

INT. THE BACKROOMS - MALL - NIGHT

DRIP... DRIP... DRIP... The abyssal darkness is punctuated by the plaintive sound of dripping water. Suddenly, the beam of a flashlight cuts through the gloom. Enter AIDEN (45), grizzled and stern, a survivalist wearing military-grade gear.

Aiden's flashlight sweeps the room, revealing old mannequins and boxes of forgotten merchandise. As he carefully navigates the scattered furniture, he pauses to examine an old MALL MAP. It's faded and torn, but clear enough to show the intricate network of backrooms and service corridors.

AIDEN
(To himself)
Now that's a helpful relic.

Suddenly, a low GROWL echoes through the narrow passage. Aiden turns sharply, his flashlight revealing a grotesque creature, half-man, half-beast, feeding on scraps of clothing.

A swift fistfight ensues. Aiden manages to impale the creature with a rusty pipe jutting from a wall. The creature recoils and runs into the darkness. Slightly wounded and adrenaline pumping, Aiden examines a worn pendant around his neck. It's inscribed: "For true hearts, the way is never lost."

A distant THUD followed by a mechanical SCREECH spur him forward. He descends down a set of steps to a lower floor.

CUT TO:

INT. SUB-BASEMENT - MALL - NIGHT

The sub-basement is a sprawl of machinery and old infrastructure. Aiden uses his flashlight to find his way through the labyrinth. Suddenly, he stumbles upon a cavernous room lined with what appears to be ancient, untouched store shelves. 

His eyes widen at the sight. A gleaming, obviously treasured artifact, THE SPHERE OF SOLACE, sits atop the highest shelf, releasing a fluorescent glow that illuminates the room.

Suddenly, the entire mall LIGHTS UP as ancient generators kick into life. Around Aiden, the half-beast creatures recoil and retreat from the sudden light. Aiden takes advantage of the chaos and sprints towards the artifact. 

A SCREAM echoes around the mall as the ALPHA BEAST, colossal and terrifying, blocks his way. Aiden stumbles backwards in shock, tripping over a coil of wires on the floor.

Aiden pulls himself to his feet and faces the Alpha Beast as it snarls ferociously. He takes a step forward, then another, and another, charging the beast. It lunges, but Aiden swiftly sidesteps, forcing it to crash into a row of shelves. 

Seizing his chance, Aiden sprints desperately towards the artifact. He reaches up, clutching the Sphere of Solace triumphantly just as Alpha Beast recovers, charging towards him.

Aiden twists the Sphere, and it unveils a blinding, radiant light, causing the Alpha Beast and its minions to snarl and retreat. A bright portal appears, and Aiden jumps through it just as the mall plunges back into darkness. 

FADE OUT.

INT. AIDEN'S SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

Aiden's wristband blinks with a faint light indicating the success of his endeavor. He places the Sphere down and slumps his weary body onto a chair. He sinks back, relief flooding his features as he looks at the artifact.
