FADE IN:

EXT. REMOTE ALIEN PLANET - NIGHT 

The TIME TRAVEL CRAFT, a sleek vessel radiating luminous blue lights, softly lands on the gritty, gold-hued terrain. The hatch opens, revealing our TIME TRAVELLERS, COMMANDER JANE (40s, calm, authoritative) and LIEUTENANT CARL (30s, adventurous, excitable).

The two, encased in high-tech suits, carefully step onto the alien soil, gazing in awe at gigantic alien plants swaying in the eerie winds. 

COMMANDER JANE 
(swallowing hard)
So far, so historical.

LIEUTENANT CARL 
(faces Jane, grinning)
Commander, you really need to work on your one-liners.

Suddenly, they spot a gleaming object nestled in a plant's curled leaf - a golden egg, roughly the size of a human head.

Carl rushes forward, enchantment replacing his cavalier demeanor. Jane steps forward too, but caution dilutes her curiosity.

LIEUTENANT CARL 
(slowly picks the "egg")
It's... it's warm, Commander.

Suddenly, the egg vibrates, emitting a low, pulsating hum. It illuminates, casting an ethereal glow on their faces. Astonishing symbols float from the egg, creating a swirling holographic message in a cryptic, alien language.

Carl and Jane exchange a startled glance.

RUNNING TIME: 1 MINUTE.

FADE OUT.
