FADE IN:

EXT. BRIGHTON BEACH - DAY

The sun shines brightly above Brighton Beach, a tourist haven. Kids build sandcastles near the shimmering ocean waves; sunbathers lay out on the hot sand. A group of teenagers SPLASH unbidden into the water.

Suddenly, the SAND starts to shift and ripple in something akin to an earthquake. Onlookers SCREAM, scattering in all directions.

CUT TO:

CLOSE UP on a SHARK FIN piercing through the sandy surface. A terrifyingly evolved GREAT WHITE SHARK emerges. It has humanoid legs, muscular and agile. Its jaws SNAP, unveiling rows of serrated teeth.

ONLOOKERS (various)

(CHORUS OF SCREAMS)

The shark charges towards the crowd. It LUNGES, and there's a blood curdling SCREAM. More sharks thrust themselves from the sand. MAYHEM spreads.

CUT TO:

The group of teenagers, isolated in the water. They see the frenzy on the beach, but they are confused and terrified. One of them points out at the ocean.

TEENAGER

Look.

A SURGING ARMY OF LAND SHARKS pour out from the sea, their arrival accenting the absolute horror on shore.

As the tourists on the beach scramble for safety, the monstrous new reality they face takes center stage: the beach, once a symbol of relaxation and escape, has turned into a nightmare, a feeding ground for the evolved undersea predators.
