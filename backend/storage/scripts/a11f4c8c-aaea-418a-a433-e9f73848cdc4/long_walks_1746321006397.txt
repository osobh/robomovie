FADE IN:

EXT. MOUNT EVEREST - DAY

Camera pans across the breathtaking mountain, colossal, steep face adorned with ice and snow. Eventually, it zooms to reveal an aged surfer turned hiker, RYAN. He is burdened with a heavy backpack but his eyes are fierce, determined.

RYAN(deep introspective voice)
(Pause)
All my life, waves were my Everest. Living, breathing giants forcing me to adapt, to navigate...

Ryan begins his slow, steady ascent, footprints trailing behind in the snow.

RYAN(continuing)
My father was an avid surfer. His last gift was a surfboard. As a child, I was petrified by the ocean... Its vastness. Its unpredictability. 

A sudden gust of wind almost throws him off balance.

RYAN(panting)
I remember... plunging head first into those terrifying waves. Each crash felt like the end… but eventually, every fall, every failure… taught me to appreciate the surf’s ebb and flow…

Now, the ascent grows steeper. Ryan struggles, gasping for air. He stops, looking around at the majestic spectacle, a far cry from his ocean.

RYAN(smiling)
Ocean, mountains... from one Everest to another, it's all about facing the fear, walking the treks life has chosen for us... 

As he pushes forth, the unforgiving chill bites into his skin but he wears an unbeatable grin. This is his journey. His chronicle.

FADE OUT.
